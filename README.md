#Team 13 Final Project

FlightPathGraph.h contains data and function delcarations for our graph and algorithms.
FlightPathGraph.cpp contains the functions to create the graph, display path, process path, find path, and solve the four problems.
main.cpp calls the functions, displays the menu, and collects input.

To compile and run:
Transfer FlightPathGraph.cpp, FlightPathGraph.h, main.cpp, and the makefile to a cse machine.
To work, flight paths need to be in the same respository and must be called "flight.txt".
Type "make" to compile the three files with the makefile.
Then type "./project" to run the project.

Project will have you select a menu option by typing a number.
The type city names in the form "City, Country".
The number of cities will depend on selected menu option.
