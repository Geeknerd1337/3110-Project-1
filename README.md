#Team 13 Final Project

FlightPathGraph.h contains data and function delcarations for our graph and algorithms
FlightPathGraph.cpp contains the functions to create the graph, display path, process path, find path, and solve the four problems
main.cpp calls the functions, displays the menu, and collects input 

To compile and run:
transfer FlightPathGraph.cpp, FlightPathGraph.h, main.cpp, and the makefile to a cse machine.
to work, flight paths need to be in the same respository and must be called "flight.txt"
type "make" to compile the three files with the makefile
then type "./project" to run the project

project will have you select a menu option by typing a number
the type city names in the form "City, Country"
the number of cities will depend on selected menu option
